## Novel Challenges of Safety, Security and Privacy in Extended Reality (CHI 2022 Workshop)

<!-- ##### Is there a risk of abuse in the future proliferation of mixed reality headsets?

##### What thical issues will arise, when the digital world is permanently in the eye sight of the users? -->

#### About

Extended Reality (AR/VR/MR) technology is becoming increasingly affordable and capable, becoming ever more interwoven with everyday life. HCI research has focused largely on innovation around XR technology, exploring new use cases and interaction techniques, understanding how this technology is used and appropriated etc. However, equally important is the investigation and consideration of risks posed by such advances, specifically in contributing to new vulnerabilities and attack vectors with regards to security, safety, and privacy that are unique to XR. For example perceptual manipulations in VR, such as redirected walking or haptic retargeting, have been developed to  enhance interaction, yet subversive use of such techniques has been demonstrated to unlock new harms, such as redirecting the VR user into a collision. This workshop will convene researchers focused on HCI, XR,  Safety, Security, and Privacy, with the intention of exploring safety, privacy, and security challenges of XR technology. With an HCI lens, workshop participants will engage in critical assessment of emerging XR technologies and develop an XR research agenda that integrates research on interaction technologies and techniques with safety, security and privacy research.

#### Program

The workshop will revolve heavily around interactive discussions which will be facilitated within three panel sessions, each focusing on topics and themes that are representing the submissions.
<!-- will be invited to submit either a 2-page position statement or a 4-page research statement and will each get the opportunity to  -->
**Participants will present their work in a 10-minute talk as part of their panel session.** Each panel session will start with introductions and short paper presentations, followed by a panel discussion, including audience questions. The panel will consist of one author of each submission, one organizer, and/or external expert. Organizers will moderate the panel and facilitate the discussion. The external expert(s) will be invited to add further expert perspectives to the discussion. The workshop will end with a final discussion panel consisting of volunteers of the former sessions and a subset of organizers and external experts.

The workshop is planned as **a one-day virtual event**. This helps us to be able to engage and lead a discussion with attendees that will not travel to CHI 2022. As an infrastructure we will use the streaming service provided by CHI 2022 or alternatively setup own instances of Big Blue Button or Zoom. The discussion during the panels will work as the main form of engaging with the individual topics. All participants will be able to contribute to the discussion by raising hands or writing in the chat. Throughout the panel discussion, multiple organizers will monitor the chat and help participants raise questions and participate in the discussion.

The tentative schedule for the workshop: **April 25th, from 15:00 CEST (14:00 BST / 09:00 EDT) to 23:00 CEST**.

#### Call for Participation

We invite two types of submissions: **a 2-page position statement** or **a 4-page research statement**. The 2-page position statement can be a motivation of interest and present an opinion piece or critical position that fits into the larger discussion and topics of the workshop (contribution type "Opinion" as defined by [Wobbrock and Kienz, 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2907069)). The 4-page research statement can be a presentation of already ongoing or planned research work in the topics of the workshop.

* Please use the **template for publication** in [CHI 2022 Publication Format](https://chi2022.acm.org/for-authors/presenting/papers/chi-publication-formats/).
* **Submissions are not anonymous and should include all author names, affiliations, and contact information.**
* Submission should be in **double-column**, and **references excluded**.
* LaTeX template user, please use `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.
* Word template user, please refer to Interim Template [on this page](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Exemplar topics might come from within the field of, but are not limited to:

* Privacy implications for the user of XR
* Privacy implications for bystanders in XR
* Safety concerns around physiological harm to the XR user
* Safety concerns around psychological harm to the XR user
* Security challenges for future XR technology
* Security challenges on manipulating the XR user
* Immersive Attacks and Human Perceptual Hacking
* Societal implications of XR technology

Once accepted, **one author will have the chance to present their work in a 10-minute talk, followed by participation in a 30-40 minute panel discussion around the topic of the submission**. The workshop will consist of three panel session, each consisting of four authors, one organizer and one external expert. We are highly encouraging submissions that are presenting new perspectives on XR, HCI and Safety, Security and Privacy. Submissions are not expected to be finished research projects but should be seen more as motivational and/or provocative piece. The workshop organizers aim for a mix of participants in terms of experience and research topics to maximize diversity of interests and viewpoints at the workshop.

Please note that one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop. Attendance can be either in person or remote. All workshop participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of ACM CHI 2022.
