Hi, I am a Ph.D. student and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher at TU Darmstadt, Germany. My thesis investigates the physical breakdown in Virtual Reality (VR) - an abrupt disruption of the VR experience caused by a collision with the physical environment. My research goal aims to understand the behavior process for physical breakdowns by conducting user experiments, providing solutions through prototyping, and exploring future mechanisms that could perpetuate safety risks.

Previouslay I worked in [the DIVA Group](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/) at Telecom Paris, France. I finished my Master's degree at National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, exploring how to integrate input controls and haptic outputs with VR head-mounted displays. Have a look at my [Projects](https://wenjietseng.com/projects/) and [CV](https://wenjietseng.com/assets/pdf/2023_CV_Wen_Jie_Tseng.pdf) for more details.
