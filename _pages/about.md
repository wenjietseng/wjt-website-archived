Wen-Jie is a 3rd year PhD student and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher in [DIVA Group](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/) at Telecom Paris, France. His research investigates the physical breakdown in Virtual Reality (VR) - an abrupt disruption of the VR experience caused by a collision with the physical environment. His research aims to understand the behavior process for physical breakdowns by conducting user experiments, provide solutions through prototyping, and explore future mechanisms that could perpetuate safety risks.

In 2023, he will continue his PhD at the Department of Computer Science, TU Darmstadt, Germany. Have a look at <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> and <a href="assets/pdf/2021_CV_Wen_Jie_Tseng.pdf">CV</a> for more details. Previously, he finished his Master degree at National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, exploring how to integrate input controls and haptic outputs with VR HMDs.
