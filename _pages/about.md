Hi, my name is Wen-Jie Tseng. I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/">DIVA Group</a> at T&eacute;l&eacute;com Paris. My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Mixed Reality (VR & AR), and Cognitive Psychology.

Currently, I focus on VR fails where people in VR colliding with furniture, falling over, hitting spectators, and experiencing excessive reactions. I am particularly interested in understanding why VR users are making these incidents and how we can design interaction techniques or systems to enforce users doing them to improve and suggest future VR safety mechanisms. My skills are creating prototypes and conducting behavioral experiments to investigate these research questions and phenomena.
<!-- I am also interested in using computational methods create models for designing interaction or understanding data. -->  

<p>Previously, I worked as a research assistant at NCTU, Taiwan. My research projects explore integrating haptic outputs or input with VR Head-Mounted Displays. Please have a look at my <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> and <a href="assets/pdf/2021_CV_Wen_Jie_Tseng.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
