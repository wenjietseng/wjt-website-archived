Thanks to J again for the meeting. In the future, I will need to frame new projects for students. The fun (and important) part is to constantly ask questions and argue back. Through this process, the project becomes neater and clear. I love it. Doing this more with colleagues. :)

I finally moved out, and I became happier since then. Although feeling lonely and isolated still happens, I have more independence. I hope I can become a more mature person.
