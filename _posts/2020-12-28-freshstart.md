In france, there are many holidays. From the week before Xmas to the first of January, I guess it's probably 2.5 weeks. I usually don't have that many in Taiwan. Hence, it feels strange when having so many days.

The mindset that you need to work very hard everyday is still somehow in my mind. One thing J told me was right, "you have to do something out of the motivation you want to do it. Otherwise it might cause stress."

Therefore in my first half of the holidays, I just do nothing and get rest. What a move. I find out that I haven't had this feeling for a while, which I really want to accomplish one task so seriously and desperately.

The good news is I have had my new year's resolutions in 2021 completed. I will change my previous working and life style step by step, and find out the things I want to dive into and put effort on it. It's the end of 2020, so let's start fresh in 2021 :D.
