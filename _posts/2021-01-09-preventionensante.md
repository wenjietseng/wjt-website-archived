### I. my health

It starts with that I sometimes feel very tired and sleepy after I had a meal. With some googling, this is called food coma (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprandial_somnolence">postprandial somnolence</a>). Although there is still no determinate theory behind this symptom, I feel this is annoying, and I want to control myself away from this. Another reason is because my stomach is getting bigger (sitting to much, and eating too many bread I guess. However, the breads are too good to get away from them), and I want to get rid of it.

The first thing I do is that I bought a simple body fat meter, and started to record my weight, fat, and so on. For the food, I control my menu to good carbohydrate (e.g., potato, sweet potato, and soba), of couse, less manufatured food. Less rice, noodles, and bread, as well as reducing alcohol. It is a very huge plan because I also require the exercise (says, jogging in citeU or swimming). I want to say wandering in Paris is an exercise but apparently I cannot say so.

What I found on my body meter is that most of the measurements are at a good and healthy statue except my high protein (21.9%). I don't know why this is happening and it seems not very good. Since my last health examination is 1.5 yrs ago, I think it's a good time to start a new one ... and yes, in Paris.

### II. apply for the examination

- Ref 1: <a href="https://www.ameli.fr/paris/assure/sante/assurance-maladie/prevention-depistages/examen-prevention-sante">Examen de prevention en sante sur ameli</a>
- Ref 2: <a href="https://fr-fr.facebook.com/peggyetseb/posts/1347803448595557/">A simple description in the traditional Chinese</a>

I started with the information with the traditional Chinese, since it is much easier for me to understand the content of those medical terms. You will need:

- register with the l'Assurance Maladie (Apply for this one is another topic LOL, Bienvenue en France !)
- have a valid social security number (this is the number for health insurance system in France)
- la carte Vitale (like 健保卡 in Taiwan)

If you have everything above, you can apply for the health examination throught this <a href="https://www.cpam75.fr/webform/FormBilan.php">LINK</a> on the page of Ref 1. Fill up the form and wait for two or three days, and the staff from this system will call you by phone. In the phone call, they will remind you the time, address, your ID, and a pen. You should also leave your stomach empty for 7-8 hours, wearing a mask, bring several documents, just like we do in Taiwan. I think it's okay to express that you don't speak French. Just say "you don't speak French very well" and ask the staff politely to switch to English in French! The center will send you a questionnaire (8 pages, it takes some time, though) to fill up. That's all I got so far, I will update after the examination on Monday.

One last thing, the health examination is free for charge (gratuit), basically. On the website they mentioned it's still possible that the local examination center charges you if there is any additional check.

Wish me luck! In both the examination and this new arrangement of my life style. I should not sleep that much and wasting time anymore. Let's fight for 2021.
