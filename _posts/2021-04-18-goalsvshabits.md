I started to read atomic habits, a book introduces many details about habits. It did help me to reveal my blind spots. One of them is that I have always been "goal-oriented". A downside of this is that goals are temporarily outcome. For example, winner and loser have the same goal. The difference is how their system works so they have a different progress, which determines win or lose at the end. I owe too much to all my supervisors because the goals I achieved were the output from their system. It's surprising to realise how far I have made through my system.

Here comes the task, what are my goals, what are the problems in my current system, and what system I should build to reach a better level of outcomes in a long run?

1/ Goals are still useful because they can show a direction. Some goals always in my mind are:

###### [ scientific research / work ]

- projects: three by myself (one uses computational approach, like ML)
- teaching: topics slides, supervise students
- intern in research lab (e.g., MSR)
- post-doc position, in long term a researcher position in France (good money and good vacation, why not LOL)

###### [ life ]

- reading books, novels
- French, use French to understand people
- music, sport, movie, travel, ...

2/ So now look at my current system, it's basically just driven by deadlines. After a deadline I don't want to do anything, so no learning, less prototyping. It lacks a clear structure and details so I can barely explore new stuff. Then I am occupying by other works (reviewing, teaching) and finally I create a random idea which becomes the next project for deadline cycle, which often times I am not completely happy after finishing the project. In terms of life, I am usually occupied by manga or series and missing out the books and movie I planned to go for. Apparently we need a better system.

3/ The new system in my mind now, of course it will need a lot of polishing plus trial and error.

###### [ breaking down one task into atomic step ]

- Example 1: exploring new project (this type of activity has no clear deadline and need to do regularly). In fact this means, read new paper, prepare idea slides, write first page, simple implementation, and pitch to others. So we break them down, even deeper, and set time slot.

- Example 2: preparing a demo (this type of activity has a clear deadline and many detail requirements). So here we need implementaion, polishing, internal test/presentation, environment setup, and mock-up running. Again, breaking them down and set time slot.

###### [ assigning time slot and execute ]

So how much time does a task need to take? I'd like to distinguish them by

- one hour: this will be one basic unit of my system from now on. A task has to be obvious, clear, and doable in one hour, can be extend to two maybe.

- \> two hours: this is where a list of objectives needs to be done. For example, preparing a demo, I might not want to do one function each day, instead, I prefer a longer duration where I can revise and address as many task as possible. Again, a clear working list of atomic task is required.

This is so far I have in my mind and let's do it.
