It's the end of CHI 2021. My first CHI is a virtual conference. Sometimes when I recall about my first year, I still feel sad and frustrated. Covid makes everything change and part of my first year sucks because of it and the other part is because of me.

Anyway, I had many chats with new people and old friends. I am happy about it. We think about several future directions. I feel dark patterns seems to be the most popular topic so that we need to work on that.

This year the goal is much more clear than the beginning. Perhaps this is an improvement and we just need to keep working.
