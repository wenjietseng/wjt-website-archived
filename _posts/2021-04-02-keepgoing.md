Today I will cut a video with Premiere. Finally I have to waive the powerpoint approach. This is good to learn new skill.

We are going to form a band in MDC. I look forward to it. Bass, again, becomes a part of my research life.

The talk yesterday went well. I will need to put more effort on doing research project, the current one and the future ones.
