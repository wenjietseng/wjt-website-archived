I completed the course --- Build A Strong Course --- where I learned a lot of basic grammar and knowledge about French, France, and franchophonie. I hope I will improve a little by little. Seems to me that listening to podcast is a good way to maintain a certain exposure to French, talking to French people as well.

I bought a takoyaki machine. Everyone seems interested in cooking with this machine. I hope this will build our group mentality a bit more.
