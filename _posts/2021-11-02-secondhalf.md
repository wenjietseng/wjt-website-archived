I start my blog again. This time I want to make it an weekly update as well, but each post has to make a topic. The topic can be a small and random thing. It can also be an important one. The change is that I have to bring in my arguement around this topic. I can update this every weekend for example. Other than that, the blog can also be my reading, daily experience, or pure record of projects.

It's the second half of my PhD. There are a lot of things to do still. I want to do project on my own. I want to learn new skill sets from the project. I want to write more, read more, present more. However, there are conflicts between my decisions and my goals. I need to change to produce good scientific research and good work. I admire people who has strong self-discipline, high motivation, and persistence of doing stuff. I need to figure out a way to make these research goals more enjoyable so that I can work on them for a long duration. Let's do it :).
