Usually, this craving grows strong when the conference is coming. Many new things are happening, and I start feeling, "yeah, I want more too." I should go for it. Then comes the next question, how do we keep this craving for learning, reading, and writing (in general, doing research/side projects)? There seems to be no clear solution. This year I will figure my way out. :D
