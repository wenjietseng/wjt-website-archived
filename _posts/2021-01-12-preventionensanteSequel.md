After the health examination. I think I am more healthier than I thought. Although for the next, I will need more disciplines on exercised, the food I eat and so on. The procedure of the exam was:

1. At the reception, a staff asked me about the covid symptoms and you need to response. Then they brought people to a room to fill up the questionnaire in French.
2. After you finished the questionnaire, an administrative asked me to go inside a room. Here, they checked your carte Vitale and ID. They also asked some basic information like who you are, where is your address. Everything went well so I could start my exam.
3. The first stop was venipuncture (prélèvement sanguin) and urine test (analyse d'urine).
4. Next, a doctor took me to a next room to ask about how I take care of my teeth. Because of covid so they only asked questions LOL.
5. Then followed a body check (height, weight, waistline, blood pressure, etc)
6. there was no eye sight checking
7. Finally, there was another doctor who asked about your medical history and answered your questions. My preliminary results seemed to be fine, so she said I should not worry about the food coma too much. Indeed, if I eat less, there is no food coma anymore.

In general, everyone I met was nice and they switched to English as soon as they found out "ohhh, this guy does not speak French!" I was able to communicate in some short sentences if I get the problem correctly. Well, not a big progress but I got one more little step forward.

Something worth to note is that I played the volleyball with people in France again. I don't know why I skip this sport so long. I played well and it's a great time to know more people in France. Also, of course, practice French more.
