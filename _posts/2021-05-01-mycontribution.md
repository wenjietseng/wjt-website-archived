I got 12 posts in April, and it was better than March. Wrting several sentences about everyday life and thoughts is helpful for retrospecting myself. Let's keep it as a routine. I wish in May I can do more posts.

Volleyball became a part of my life now. I felt satisfied when I make other people to play better. For example, my pass made M played better attacks. These are my contributions during the volleyball groups in cite u.

I want more contributions to my phd thesis.
