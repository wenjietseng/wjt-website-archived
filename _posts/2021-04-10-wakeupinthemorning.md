I woke up in the morning around 06h30 for the video call from C. Perhaps the reason is because I had a deal with another person so I had to get up. Another reason might be I slept early yesterday, somewhere between 12h00 - 12h30. It was great. I had not had this feeling for a long long while. It made me feel I have control over my day, my body, and my mind better.

The next question is, how long can we last this habit? Can I get up at this time everyday?

T recommended an art game called [every day the same dream](http://www.molleindustria.org/everydaythesamedream/everydaythesamedream.html) to me. The game was about alienation and refusal of labor.

Playing bass comforts me a lot. What I need the most now comes back to research again, and I have to get the job done. Pushing the ongoing project and pursuing the new ones. :D Keep it up!
