I hate my neighbors more and more since someone bought a huge set of speakers. This week and last week they played it too often, almost every evening till midnight. They dropped the beats and had so many parties and smokes and alcohols. Not to mention the risk of covid, they made me hard to concentrate and interrupted me working from home.

They are good people at the usual time, nice and outgoing. However, when they are making all the noises to fxxk my ears and affecting my work, I start to hate them. The changes of my thoughts are significantly strong. So far I have no clue on how to solve the problem. I will communicate for a few more times if it keeps bothering me. Also I hope they can party somewhere else because curfew becomes 21h00 next week. Another thing is that they have several strangers (to me) and I don't like that so much.
