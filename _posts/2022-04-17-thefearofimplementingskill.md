Since my background is in Psychology, and now I am working in CS, there is always a fear of "not good enough coding skills." I participated in several projects using prototyping. I should not have such worry, and it seems unnecessary. Whenever I see a work or people with strong implementation skills, I think perhaps I should have this as well. This feeling is sth I should make into a habit in the coming 3 yrs. The goal is to have two projects involving system building (software/hardware/both). I think it will be fun, and we still have time to have this as a part of our Ph.D.
