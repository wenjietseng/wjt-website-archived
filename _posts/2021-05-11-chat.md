Chatting with people seems to be a complicated task to me. Sometimes I am not used to initiate a chat or sometimes I feel what the conversation does not grow into a conversation I imagined at the beginning. Perhaps I have too many assumption. A better way is let go and trial-and-error? Let's say we sample a great amount of chat, at least a small part of them will be good ones.

I am still acting bad at socialing. I guess there is nothing to lose when cutting into a conversation full of completely strangers.
