Friday: biking from Palaiseau to 14th (~20 km) + volley.

Saturday: biking from 14th to Stade LÃ©o Lagrange (5 km * 2) + volley.

Playing volleyball became a part of my life again. I did not see that is coming. It was as fun as our music group, and it was good for health. Although I had too much exercise this weekend and did not do much about my stuff. Anyway, I knew many new friends recently. I felt satisfied about the current amount of socializing. Because more research work is coming, I will need to focus more on my job. However I will always appreciate their kind heart for accepting me as a part.
