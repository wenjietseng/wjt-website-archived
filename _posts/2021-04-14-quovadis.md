[Quo vadis?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quo_vadis%3F) is a Latin phrase of saying "Where are you going?". Apparently I have been lost for a while in my first year. Now I have some directions in my mind but to nail them down to concrete plan or project ... well ... I am not doing well actually. More efforts need to be there, like breaking down a goal into several executable steps, make use of time, and so on.

It's a hard task, but we have to solve it.
