Recently I found a crazy artist, Marc Rebillet. He has a fantastic style and high quality of music. However, his performance is pushy and maniac. The lyrics are aggressive as well. I like this weird guy and hope I have a chance to be present at his live performance.

I check Y's doctoral consortium. It is too good. Although I have not read the details in his paper, I feel he has a structured approach to his research questions. Besides, I feel he wants to change some fundamental stuff in HCI. Bold and solid. I like his style. The way he deal with a phd, or say, his attitude, is sth I lack with.

So I look back to myself. Am I the same type of person? I want to do sth. But I don't know whether my problem will change anything. In fact, I feel I am not even good at dealing with all of my work. I am slow and inefficient. Projects are often delay. I am unhappy about my current state.

Then comes how to improve. Let's focus on one task at a time.
