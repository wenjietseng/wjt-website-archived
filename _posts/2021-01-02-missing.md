After a very long vacation, I have to come back. I really did not do anything during these two weeks :D. There are some little revision on the paper, but the original plan has totally fucked up.

This makes me start to wonder, why I am not able to do the things I planned? Sometimes it is because I was too greedy, but usually, I think I don't want to do them.

Then the next question jumps into, why I plan things I don't want to do? Before I am going to plan things in the future, they should be sth I am willing and passion to do.

In fact, when I was writing this post, I was thinking about my family and friends and people I know in Taiwan. The life is so solitary so I kind of missing everyone I know in my home country.

I miss all the foods that I love and all the social event I had. Hopefully there will be a day I could go back for a long vacation (what I learned in France LOL). One important thing to do is to build a new network that I can find my own stability in Paris. Still dunno how to get one. That's sth we have to work out this year.
