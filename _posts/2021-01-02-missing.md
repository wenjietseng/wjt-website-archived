After a very long vacation, I have to come back. I really did not do anything during these two weeks :D. There are some little revision on the paper, but the original plan has totally fucked up.

This makes me start to wonder, why I am not able to do the things I planned? Sometimes it is because I was too greedy, but usually, I think I don't want to do them.

Then the next question jumps into, why I plan things I don't want to do? Before I am going to plan things in the future, they should be sth I am willing and passion to do.
