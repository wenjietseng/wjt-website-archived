Don't know why I started my phd with covid,

I have no idea how I can go through it.

Can't remember the last time people squeeze in the lab,

we work in an empty building with no man.

Struggled to keep the morale up,

always not satisfied with myself.

Anxious thoughts again occupy in my mind.

I hate all of this, I hate me,

hope the low mood only stays one night.
