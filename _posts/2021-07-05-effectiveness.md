1/ "If you...

- develop a bias for moving fast
- consistently ask, ``What's the real goal here and is there a better way to accomplish it?''

... you can accomplish a lot in one life."

2/ "Hard work is the engine. Strategy is the GPS. It's difficult to get anywhere without hard work. If the engine stops running, progress stalls, but you'll waste a lot of gas without a good strategy. It's easier to make progress when you're following the optimal path."

3/ "Vision is the bottleneck of talent. Most talent is wasted because people do not clearly know what they want. It's not a lack of effort, but a lack of direction. There are many capable people in the world, but relatively few that focus on what matters."
