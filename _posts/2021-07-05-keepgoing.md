It has been a year since I arrived in France. I have some progress, but not in the optimized working style. A lot of hard works need to be done. You are on a good track and you just need to pursue more.

My life finally settles down I feel. I have my vanmoof, and I have my band. I am glad we can play Jazz together. Two projects currently I am working on are nice research direction and I think I should keep making progress on them.

There is still a workshop to go in the end of August. I look forward to this summer.

Just do it! Wen-Jie.
