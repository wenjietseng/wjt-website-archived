In the group meeting S presented their job talk that a researcher on the job market is looking for a academic position. French system has several institutions that provide permanent research position to researhers and engineers from all nations. For example, CNRS (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) and Inria (Insititut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique) are famous research institutes for computer science, also for people like me working in Human-Computer Interaction.

Providing a job talk is not easy. When I looked back at my talk for diva group, it lacks a lot of specific details. Although "dark" side of technology is a fun topic, I didn't make them into research question and create why this direction is important. Shaping my research direction - that has to be interesting and important in our field, also producing scientific knowledge - is a challenging problem. It is challenging during and after my phd, it would be if we continued to work in scientific research, and it will always be because of pursuing meaning in our life.

I hanged out with more people recently, T, E, A, Y, and volleyball people. The phd life with covid seems not so doomed anyway. At least I know where I should I go in both research and life in Paris. Although executing every detailed step is still a huge problem for me. @@a''
