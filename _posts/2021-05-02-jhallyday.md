H, A, B, and I had a pet-dej of [kanafeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh) and espresso in the afternoon. It was chill and lovely because we shared good foods together. I hoped I can also share 'my stuff' to my friends. Perhaps sharing sth related to the taiwanese culture or food and sth about technology stuff and gaming could be cool.

I listened to Johnny Hallyday, the very first rock and pop singer in France. His songs are a bit like 伍佰. J'en adore :).
