I sometimes feel extreme sleepy, which bothers me a lot. Because I cannot do what I want to do but stay unconscious for one or two hours. Normally, I sleep six to eight hours. In some cases I might sleep like ten or even 12 hours before I am fully recovered. I hate the feeling of being bad at controlling my personal time schedule.

What if my body had some trouble, and that is the reason why I need so many sleep? I have to be more careful about my life and my decisions.
