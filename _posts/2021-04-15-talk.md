I gave a talk today which still had tremendous problems to improve.

When can I create a good enough presentation? I understand a perfect talk might not exist. What I want here is sth that approximates perfect, like a 99% coverage of all the errors. Well ... perhaps I am too greedy but I do want to have this skill, saying that I can revise sth by myself towards a good state. Perhaps I did not spend enough time on it.
