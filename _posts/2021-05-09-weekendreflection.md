Perhaps I spent too much time on play volleyball and social life? Sometimes it occupied my time...

V invited me to his event where many good people around him gathered together. I appreciated that V brought me in his community. As a weirdo who has no proper French skill and demur, I found they are opened to it and willing to welcome me. It seemed that I am still not taking "using French" serious. I have to make plans and work on that, just like research.
