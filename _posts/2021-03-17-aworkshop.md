It was not that hard as I thought. I was happy to know E, Eu, J, and R. Chatted with M after a busy day. We talked about that I once wanted to live in a big city (Taipei for example) before. Perhap it was an unrealistic imagination of my future life. Indeed my life became completely different as I thought while I was 18-23.

My mind has changed during this year because I feel it is not about where I am but what (and how) I do. Sometimes I just hate myself that I could not realize this insight earlier Although I understand that, I still prefer to stay in a big city like Paris. Of course, we have an international airport and a bunch of things and covid.
