There are lots of things to write about the last week. The party at S and T's were excellent, so as the meetup at J and T's. I appreciate so much that they are all kind and generous to me. Although the FM did not go well but in fact I found other things to do in the rest of my phd. It's a good thing right?

I have to be more cautious about every decision I make so that I can achieve my goals in the future. It seems to be a hard problem but we can solve it. The way is that we have to be aware of many details and work hard and be nice to people and having persistence and patient and passion and a bit of luck.

1.8 yrs to go. I believe I have to work harder and I will do so and I can do it.
