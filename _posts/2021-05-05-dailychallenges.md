I want to set some daily challenges. For example, get up challenge, writing challenge, new project challenge, reading challenge, and French challenge. For now I am working on get up and writing. The writing challenge is about writing the blog and also one paragraph a day for projects. For the moment I have to keep them running.

The next step will be new project challenge, literally doing new projects. Also reading challenge, read articles, papers, novels, and so on. At some point French challenge will join and I expect I am going to have a busy life this year.
