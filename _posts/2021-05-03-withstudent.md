Oh my, I was terrible with supervising student. It seemed to be the first time that I have to lead a group project with students, AND I WAS HORRIBLE! One reason was that I wasn't fully prepared. For example, writing down the expectation of their idea and evaluating how it works within two months. I was so immature and I hate myself a bit more. The timing to guide them was also important. I appreciated that J helped me when students and I were all getting lost. Need to be better next time.

I went to quintal editions with M. I hope I did well. :)
