I am going to simply update my recently situation again. First, I still write sth during the past three months. The reason for not publishing them is because the content becomes private and personal. It is basically about my feelings and it's not possible for me to share them. Second, as I mention I have experienced a lot of emotional swings recently, the productivity becomes extremely low. My direction and motivation of working in research disapear for a while. Until this week, I start to find them back. Third, I start to compose music with lyrics. It's a fun process and I enjoy it. I will keep it up. Finally, VPPM got accepted in CHI 2022! You are doing a great job, Wen-Jie. You will do more in the near future and during your career. Don't be negative to yourself. Be confident and brave to continue your PhD life.

### Note about the grand picture of my future research: hacking human mind

I finished this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yhg7NmTeVg), a conversation between Kara Swisher, Daniel Kahneman, and Yuval Noah Harari. They mention something that caught my attention. The brain and AI are two rising area and I should be aware of them and explore them. Also, with these knowledge we can start to think about how to hack the human mind.
