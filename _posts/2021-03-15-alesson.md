My PC couldn't restart so that I went for reset all the software. It was painful for restoring everything back. Some of my pages in the browser were also gone and I couldn't find them back.

I gained one insights from this incident. If something I just left it there for a while, I probably not do it anymore because 1) it's not important at all and 2) I don't want to. The solution to this is to understand whether it is important at first. If it is, then fix things right away. Even if we cannot do it immediately, let's document it in a draft for the next time. Otherwise we will just do nothing at the end.
