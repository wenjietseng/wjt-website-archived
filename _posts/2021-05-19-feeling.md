I updated my CV a bit because I need to apply a workshop in Inria. I was so focused on updating these materials.

I want to have the same feeling while doing my research (e.g., writing and implementation and all!). Perhaps updating my CV is an easy problem but research ... is a hard one. To tackle down a hard problem we have to be more patience and work on little things. A series of small and successful decisions will eventually lead us to our final goal. :)
