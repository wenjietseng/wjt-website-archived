This was the first day of 2021. I started to getting better: wake up earlier, do things step-by-step, and work hard.

J sent me a video about sys 1 and 2. The youtuber made the video easy to understand and also said one thing that changes my mind. The conclusion from the video is, learning and thinking are uncomfortable. I think I was not willing to take this unpleasant feeling before.

This is the reason why I used to read and watch things repeatly because I am used to them. It's easier to stay in the comfort zone. I feel shocked and sad when I knew this. If I want to learn and create more in my research career, I must to change.

So don't protect myself too much, WJ. Embrace these uncomfortable feelings and do good research. The goal of having full control of sys 2 is not possible. What we can do is to create realistic goals and take them down one by one. If the uncomfortable feelings shows up, think about this post and just do it :D.

I watched Bed and Board (Domicile conjugal). Kyoko is quite crazy, especially the love letters. The movie crafts each character well and I can see how they changed through the storyline. If I had a better understanding of French, the movie would be more interesting.
