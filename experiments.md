2. touch white cube in front of you using your index fingertip (with a red pointer on it). Either left or right is good.
3. two targets become green. Choose one of your arm to touch one of the greens. The order of green sphere doesn't matter. 
4. You will see the green sphere you touch turns back blue. Now the task starts, use the arm touched with the first green, to touch the other green sphere as fast and correct as possible.
5. To have a succeed task, you have to use the SAME arm for both greens. A beep sound occurs when the task succeed.
