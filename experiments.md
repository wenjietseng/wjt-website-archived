## WELCOME to the User Study of FingerMapper!
Thank you for participating our study. Before sign up the consent form and start, please read all the information on this page carefully since our study would be remote. I would introduce what FingerMapper does, how to interact with it, and how to setup the study by yourself. Grab a cup of tea and let's go!

## A. FingerMapper and the Purpose of this Study
FingerMapper is a mapping technique that controls VR arm reaching in confined and public spaces through small finger motions. FingerMapper enables users to efficiently interacting in VR with less physical movements, less fatigue, and preserving virtual body ownership.

### Four techniques
- Direct:

Our goal: We would like to ask you to evaluate four techniques with two different target layouts. There will be eight combination, each has 30 tasks. After completing each technique, there would be one questionnaire.

## B. Study Setup
Please follow the instruction to setup the study environment, thank you!

### B.1 Oculus Quest
- Set guardian as stationary
- Disable guardian in developer tab (Change your Quest to Developer Mode to do so)
- Upload the apk by SideQuest (link)

### B.2 Space
- Find a chair and put it in the middle of an empty space.
- Remove all the possible obstructions in front, left, and right of yourself.

### B.3 Body measurements
Measure the following body dimensions, as shown in the figure (b).
- arm span
- arm length
- index finger length

After that, please maintain the posture in figure (a), wear your headset then continue in VR.

### B.4 Reposition yourself using thumb-pinky pinch
After reposition, please enter your user number. The user number will be sent to you after you sign up the consent form.

### B.5 Enter your dimensions
Enter your user number. Adjust the body dimensions to your data, check if you can reach all the targets. If you cannot reach all targets, please reduce the arm span a little bit and try again.

### B.6 The task
1. Touch the white cube in front of you with the red pointer on your virtual hand (both hands can start the task).
2. Two targets become green. Choose one of your arm to touch one of the greens. The order of green sphere doesn't matter. 
3. Once you touch the first green sphere with the left virtual hand for example, the green sphere you touched turns into blue, and the task starts. 
4. Use the same arm that you touched the first green sphere to touch the other green sphere as fast and correct as possible.
5. To have a succeed task, you have to use the SAME arm for both greens. A beep sound occurs when the task succeed.
6. Before each combination, there is a practicing phase. Practice the task until you are completely comfortable with the technique. Touch the red cube to end practicing and start the formal study.

### B.8 End! Send the data back
There are three files in this directory.
```
sdcard > android > data > com.DefaultCompany.FingerSaber >
file"UserNo"_frameLog.csv
file"UserNo"_questionnaire.csv
file"UserNo"_study.csv

For example: file20_frameLog.csv, file20_questionnaire.csv, file20_study.csv
```

(how to send back?)

## C. Ready to Go
- Consent form (link)
- user no 
- apk link (link)
- your body dims
- clarification and gratitudes (how?)
- privacy, laws (how?)
