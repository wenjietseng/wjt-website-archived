## WELCOME to the User Study of FingerMapper!
Thank you for participating our study. First, I would introduce what FingerMapper does and how to interact with it. The next step would be sign up the consent form and provide your demographic data through the link in part B. Finally, please read all the information in part C carefully before you start the study since our study would be remote. The instructions in part C would guide you to setup the study. Grab a cup of tea and let's go!

## A. FingerMapper and the Purpose of this Study
FingerMapper is a finger mapping technique that allows users to control arm interaction inside Virtual Reality (VR) using small finger motions. These small and energy efficient finger motions reduce the physical path length and fatigue during the interaction while preserving virtual body ownership inside confined spaces.

### Four techniques
- Direct: the virtual arms would follow the direction of your index finger.

- Attach: there is a ray casting through the direction of your index finger. Bending your index finger inwards can retract the virtual hand closer to your shoulder.

- Physical hand: the virtual hand is your physical hand.

- Raycasting: using a ray casting from your fingertip to select.

Our goal: We would like to ask you to evaluate four techniques with two different target layouts. There will be eight combination, each has 30 tasks. After completing each technique, there would be one questionnaire.

## B. Ready to Go
- <a href="https://form.jotform.com/202294350144346">The LINK to the Consent Form</a>
- Once I received your consent form and demographic data, I will send you the user number. 
- Download the apk (link)
- Follow the setup in part C.

## C. Study Setup
Please follow the instruction to setup the study environment, thank you!

### C.1 Oculus Quest
- <a href="https://support.oculus.com/guardian/">Set guardian as stationary.</a>
- <a href="https://frl.nyu.edu/disable-guardian-on-the-oculus-quest/">Disable guardian in developer tab. The Quest has to be Developer Mode.</a>
- <a href="https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/">Upload the apk by SideQuest</a>

### C.2 Space
- Find a chair and put it in the middle of an empty space.
- Remove all the possible obstructions in front, left, and right of yourself.

### C.3 Body measurements
Measure the following body dimensions, as shown in the figure (b).
- arm span
- arm length
- index finger length

After that, please maintain the posture in figure (a), then put on your headset then continue in VR.

### C.4 Reposition yourself using thumb-pinky pinch
After reposition, please enter your user number. The user number will be sent to you after you signed up the consent form.

### C.5 Enter your dimensions
Right after entering your user number, you need to adjust the body dimensions to what you just measured. Remember to check if you can reach all the targets. If you cannot reach all targets, please reduce the arm span a little bit and try again.

### C.6 The task

1. Touch the white cube in front of you with the red pointer on your virtual hand (both hands can start the task).
2. Two spheres turn green. Choose one of your arm to touch one of the green sphere. The order of green sphere doesn't matter. 
3. Once you touch the first green sphere with the left virtual hand for example, the green sphere you touched turns into blue, and the task starts. 
4. Use the same arm that you touched with the first green sphere to touch the other green sphere as fast and correct as possible.
5. To have a succeed task, you have to use the SAME arm for both green spheres. A beep sound occurs when the task succeed.
6. For each condition, there is a practicing phase. Practice the task until you are completely comfortable with the technique. Touch the red cube to end practicing and start the formal study.

### C.7 The questionnaire
After finishing one technique (one mapping with two layouts), there would be a questionnaire. Please fill them up as shown in the video below.
