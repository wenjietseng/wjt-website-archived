**Keywords:** CS, NCTU, Taiwan / Technical HCI / Psychology / Bass

**Bio:** I am a Master Student in CS, NCTU, Hsinchu, Taiwan. My research interest is Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), especially in technical HCI.

Currently I am working on input technique in virtual reality. I am interesting in exploring the novel input/output user interfaces and actuating human body with the latest techniques.

Besides research, I go swimming and play bass. Love drinking beer and music. Sometimes go mountain climbing.
