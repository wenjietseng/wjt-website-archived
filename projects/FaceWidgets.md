We present FaceWidgets, a novel HMD that integrates physical controls with a lift extender on the backside allowing for the direct manipulation for the VR interaction. Two novel interaction designs, widget canvas and palm-facing gesture, can streamline the back-of-device tangible interaction for HMD. Finally, we conducted three studies that suggest the depth necessary to visualize virtual widgets, the necessity of hand visualization during face widgets interactions, and user preference of hand representations.
