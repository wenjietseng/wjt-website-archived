Giving haptic feedback to VR users becomes a very popular idea for VR gaming. In this project, we implement two prototypes to generate haptic feedback for a VR zombie shooting game. The first one is a vest with eight vibrators, which vibrate in a circulation while the player gets hurt.

The second protype contains a fan and a spray. It combines two feedback to simulate the gust in the VR dungeon. The outlook and 3D models are shown as follows. We use a servo motor to press the spray.

<h4><b>Teammates</b></h4>
<p>
This project was collaborated with two talented partners, Susanta Sharma and Timothy William, both of them are PhD students at NCTU currently. And it is also the first project that I participated from sketching early ideas to implementing the final prototype. Since I came from psychology, everything of hardware and software was new to me. Fortunately, these two EE guys had patience and tought me many details about implementation. I really appreciate them for working together in this project.

Susanta developed the game structure and the circuits. Timo designed the 3D models and integrated the hardwares. My contributions were a part of arduino code and integrating the hardwares.
