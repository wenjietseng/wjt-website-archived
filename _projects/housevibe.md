In August 2021, I participated in [creartathon](https://creartathon.com/2021_archive/) at Inria Saclay. Participants have to create an idea around AI, art and HCI. In one week, we have to prototype the idea and exhibit our work.

### HouseVibe

House Vibes expresses the emotional state of the house through an interactive visualization. Resident comprehends how they affect the ecosystem, empathise with their house environment needs and tries to bring back the balance through their interaction with the generative sculptural lights.
