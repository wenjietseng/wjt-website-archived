We present FaceWidgets, a device integrated with the backside of a head-mounted display (HMD) that enables tangible interactions using physical controls. To allow for near range-to-eye interactions, our first study suggested displaying the virtual widgets at 20 cm from the eye positions, which is 9 cm from the HMD backside. We propose two novel interactions, widget canvas and palm-facing gesture, that can help users avoid double vision and allow them to access the interface as needed. Our second study showed that displaying a hand reference improved performance of face widgets interactions. We developed two applications of FaceWidgets, a fixed-layout 360 video player and a contextual input for smart home control. Finally, we compared four hand visualizations against the two applications in an exploratory study. Participants considered the transparent hand as the most suitable and responded positively to our system.
<!-- We present FaceWidgets, a novel HMD that integrates physical controls with a lift extender on the backside allowing for the direct manipulation for the VR interaction. Two novel interaction designs, widget canvas and palm-facing gesture, can streamline the back-of-device tangible interaction for HMD. Finally, we conducted three studies that suggest the depth necessary to visualize virtual widgets, the necessity of hand visualization during face widgets interactions, and user preference of hand representations.  -->
