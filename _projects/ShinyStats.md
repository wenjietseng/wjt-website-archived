<h3><b>Creating Shiny Applications for Teaching Statistical Concepts</b></h3>

<p>
This paper demonstrates how to implement interactive graphics in "Shiny", a web application with RStudio, to illustrate statistical and psychological models. Three pedagogical examples are chosen: relating the minimization of the sum of squares to the fitted regression lines moving from priors to posterior distributions as data accumulate in Bayesian inference and sweeping out ROC curves as criterion changes for signal detection theory models. In addition to providing example scripts for these webapplications we also discuss advantages of embedding interactive graphics in Shiny for teaching and learning statistical and psychological modeling.
